An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.

# Introduction 
An is a program that manages the computer hardware. It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware. 

- An operating system is similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work.


- To understand the Operating system of two view point..
    -  that of the user and that of the system.

    ### User View
    -  The user's view of the computer varies according to the interface being used. Most computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor/ keyboard/ mouse, and system unit. Such a system is designed for one user to monopolize its resources.
    -  `resource utilization` - how various hardware and software resources are shared. Performance is, of course, important to the user;
    - In other cases, a user sits at a terminal connected to a or a Other users are accessing the sance computer through other terminals. These users share resources and may exchange information. The operating system in S"Llclc cases is designed to maximize resource utilization- to assure that all available CPU time, memory, and I/0 are used efficiently and that no individual user takes more than her fair share.

    ### System View
    - From the computer's point of view, the operating system is the program most intimately involved with the hardware.
    - A computer system has many resources that may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, file-storage space, I/0 devices, and so on. The operating system acts as the manager of these resources. Facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources, the operating system must decide how to allocate them to specific programs and users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly.

## STORAGE DEFINITIONS AND NOTATION
- A is the basic unit of computer storage. It can contain one of two values, zero and one.
- A is 8 bits, and on most computers it is the smallest convenient chunk of storage. For example, most computers don't have an instruction to move a bit but do have one to move a byte.
- A word is generally made up of one or more bytes. For example, a computer may have instructions to move 64-bit (8-byte) words.
- A kilobyte, or KB, is 1,024 bytes; a megabyte, or MB, is 1,0242 bytes; and a gigabyte, or GB, !s 1,0243 bytes. 

Toward this goal, computer hardware is constructed. Since bare hardware alone is not particularly easy to use, application programs are developed. These programs require certain common operations, such as those controlling the II0 devices. The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought together into one piece of software: the operating system.
