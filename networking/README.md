
# Hardware


The term Hardware is used to refer to the physical component of any electronics device such as cpu,peripheral device and its memory

- it is the physical unit of a device
- it is the complete unit or device
- it can be change after production 
- it is the body of the device 
Ex:- keyboard,remote,speaker,PCB,Motherboard etc..

- hardware cannot  operate without `firmware`

# Firmware

`firmware` is a set of instruction or a programs written in machine language which are used to operate  hardware.
 
 - it is a set of instruction 
 - it is stored in hardware
 - it cannot be or hardly change after production
 - it is the heart of the hardware 

 Ex:- PC BIOS , timing and control machanism of washing machine,TV programm or remote.

 - A firmware operate on hardware

 ```
  Note:->  BIOS is only appropriate for Referring to the startup firmware of the motherboar  itself 
 ```

 # Software 

 A collection of instruction or programm that tell the computer how to perform a perticular task.

 *It is of two type*
    - System Software ,  Application Software

 - software generally stored in user accessible memory 
 - Software is change constantly
 - Software can be a very big while firmware is usually small
 
 Ex:-> OS,MS Office, Google Chrome etc


# INTRODUCTION

Each of the past three centuries was dominated by a single new technology.

- The 18th century was the era of the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. 
- The 19th century was the age of the steam engine.
- The 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and distribution.
- As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging in the 21st century
## Computer Network 

- The term ‘‘computer network’’ to mean a col- lection of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology. 
- Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and communication satellites can also be used.
- They are usually connected together to make larger networks, with the Internet being the most well-known example of a network of networks.
*Note:-> There is considerable confusion in the literature between a `computer network` and a `distributed system.`*
### distributed system

- The key distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single coherent system.
- A layer of software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. 
- A well-known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web. It runs on top of the Internet and presents a model in which everything looks like a document (Web page).

### computer network 
- In a computer network, this coherence, model, and software are absent. Users are exposed to the actual machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way.
- If the machines have different hard- ware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users.
- If a user wants to run a program on a remote machine, he† has to log onto that machine and run it there.

In effect, a `distributed system`is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree of `cohesiveness` and `transparency`. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with the software (es- pecially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.

# Uses of computer network 

Service Provided by the Network for Companies:

• Many organizations have a large number of computers in operation. These computers may be within the same building, campus, city or different cities.

• Even though the computers are located in different locations, the organizations want to keep track of inventories, monitor productivity, do the ordering and billing etc.

• The computer networks are useful to the organizations in the following ways:

1. Resource sharing.

2. For providing high reliability.

3. To save money.

4. It can provide a powerful communication medium.


## Resource sharing
• It allows all programs, equipment and data available to anyone on the network irrespective of the physical location of the resource and the user.

• Show in Fig (a) and (b) which shows a printer being shared and different information being shared.

## Access to remote information
Access to remote information involves interaction· between a person and a remote database. Access to remote information comes in many forms like:

(i) Home shopping, paying telephone, electricity bills, e-banking, on line share market etc.

(ii) Newspaper is. On-line and is personalized, digital library consisting of books, magazines, scientific journals etc.

(iii) World wide web which contains information. about the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies, recreation, science, sports etc.

## Person to person communication
Person to person communication includes:

(i) Electronic-mail (e-mail)

(ii) Real time e-mail i.e. video conferencing allows remote users to communicate with no delay by seeing and hearing each other. Video-conferencing is being used for remote school, getting medical opinion from distant specialists etc.

(iii) Worldwide newsgroups in which one person posts a message and all other subscribers to the newsgroup can read it or give their feedback’s.

## Metcalfe’s law

- In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number two computer vendor in the world (after IBM). When asked why Dig- ital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way, he said: ‘‘There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.’’ History showed otherwise and Digital no longer exists. People initially bought computers for word processing and games. Recently, the biggest reason to buy a home com- puter was probably for Internet access. Now, many consumer electronic devices, such as set-top boxes, game consoles, and clock radios, come with embedded computers and computer networks, especially wireless networks, and home net- works are broadly used for entertainment, including listening to, looking at, and creating music, photos, and videos.
- Internet access provides home users with connectivity to remote computers. As with companies, home users can access information, communicate with other people, and buy products and services with e-commerce. The main benefit now comes from connecting outside of the home. Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ether- net, hypothesized that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users because this is roughly the number of different connections that may be made (Gilder, 1993). This hypothesis is known as ‘‘Metcalfe’s law.’’ It helps to explain how the tremendous popularity of the Internet comes from its size.



# What is network neutrality?
Network neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs), including cable companies like Time Warner and wireless providers like Sprint, should treat all internet traffic equally. It says your ISP shouldn’t be allowed to block or degrade access to certain websites or services, nor should it be allowed to set aside a "fast lane" that allows content favored by the ISP to load more quickly than the rest.


# What’s the argument for network neutrality?

When Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook in his Harvard dorm room, he didn’t need to ask Comcast, Verizon, or other internet service providers to add the site to their networks. He also didn’t have to pay these companies extra fees to ensure that Facebook would work as well as the websites of established companies. Instead, as soon as he created the Facebook website, it was automatically available from any internet-connected computer in the world.

That’s network neutrality.

Advocates say network neutrality is a big reason there has been so much innovation on the internet over the last two decades. Network neutrality keeps the barriers to entry for new websites and internet applications low. Supporters say that freedom has allowed the creation of dozens of innovative online services such as Google, Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, Skype, and more.

They worry that without net neutrality, the internet would become less hospitable to new companies and innovative ideas. For example, if large ISPs began requiring video-streaming sites to pay extra to deliver video content to their customers, the expense and hassle of negotiating deals with dozens of network owners could make it difficult for the next YouTube to get traction.
